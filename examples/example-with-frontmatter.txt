# Getting Started with MDX

MDX is a powerful format that combines Markdown with JSX, allowing you to write interactive content.

## What is MDX?

MDX lets you use JSX in your Markdown content. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

## Basic Syntax

### Headings

Use `#` for headings:

```markdown
# H1 Heading
## H2 Heading
### H3 Heading
```

### Lists

Create lists with `-` or `*`:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for code:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

### Links and Images

Create links: [OpenAI](https://openai.com)

Add images: `![Alt text](image-url.jpg)`

## Front Matter

Every MDX file should start with Front Matter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Title"
date: "2024-01-15"
summary: "Brief description"
---
```

## Best Practices

1. Always include Front Matter
2. Use proper heading hierarchy
3. Keep paragraphs concise
4. Use code blocks for code examples
5. Add alt text to images

## Conclusion

MDX is a great way to create rich, interactive content. Start writing today!
