# Simple Blog Post

This is a simple blog post without Front Matter. The converter will automatically add it!

## Introduction

When you don't include Front Matter, the converter will create a default one with:
- A placeholder title
- Today's date
- An empty summary field

## Content

You can write your content normally:

- Lists work fine
- Code blocks work too
- Everything is preserved

### Code Example

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

## Conclusion

The converter makes it easy to work with both formats. Just write your content and let the tool handle the rest!
